# Exercise #1: Construct for loops that accomplish the following tasks:
    # a. Print the numbers 0 - 20, one number per line.
for num in range(20):
    print(num)
    # b. Print only the ODD values from 3 - 29, one number per line.
    for num in range(3,29,2)
    # c. Print the EVEN numbers 12 to -14 in descending order, one number per line.
         for num in range(12,-14,-1)
         print(num)
            

    # d. Challenge - Print the numbers 50 - 20 in descending order, but only if the numbers are multiples of 3. 
    # (Your code should work even if you replace 50 or 20 with other numbers).
       for num in range(50,19,-1)
           if num%3 == 0:
                print(num)
